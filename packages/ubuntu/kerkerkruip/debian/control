Description: Interactive fiction roguelike game
 Kerkerkruip is a dungeon crawling game that brings together the interactive
 fiction medium with the roguelike genre. You take on the role of an adventurer
 in a randomly generated dungeon, whose only hope of escape is to destroy the
 mighty wizard Malygris. The game has been designed to offer a diverse array of
 meaningful tactical and strategical options, and combines the thrill of random
 combat with the skill of complex puzzle solving.
